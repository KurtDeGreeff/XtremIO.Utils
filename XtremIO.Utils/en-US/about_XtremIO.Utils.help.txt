SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the XtremIO.Utils Powershell module, its intentions, and some of
    its uses

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A detailed, full description of the subject or purpose of the module.

    The XtremIO.Utils PowerShell module provides cmdlets for interacting with
    EMC's XtremIO storage arrays by communicating with the XtremIO Management
    Server (XMS) that manages the given storage array.

  GET CMDLETS
      The Get-* cmdlets in this module are meant to provide rich PowerShell
      objects to represent the objects available on the given storage array and
      via the given XMS.  There is nearly 1:1 coverage of XtremIO objects by
      Get-* cmdlets in this module.  Additionally, the module provides an easy
      way to return the "full" object from the API response with most of the
      Get-* cmdlets, and a way to provide full URIs of objects for which to
      retrieve information.

    Object URI
        Objects returned from the this module generally have a URI property
        that is the full URI of the given object in the API.  You can use this
        URI to get access the target object precisely.  While this is not the
        most convenient way to get information for an object, it can be quite
        handy for when you are exploring objects in the API.  It is also
        extremely useful for when you want to experiment with additional query
        string parameters and values, or for when, say, the API has been
        updated, but this PowerShell module has not yet been updated to cover
        the API changes.  See the EXAMPLES section for details of these topics.

    Return Full Response
        Along with being able to specify an URI for a given object, you can
        tell the Get-* cmdlets in this module to return the full object from
        the API response.  While this module strives to provide all of the
        pertinent/useful properties of an object retrieved form the API, there
        may be a time when you want to see _all_ of the properties for the
        given object, raw, as returned by the API.  To easily do so, you can
        specify the -ReturnFullResponse switch parameter to most of the Get-*
        cmdlets here.  See the EXAMPLES section for details on the full
        response.

  NEW CMDLETS
      The New-* cmdlet are crafted with the most common object-creation tasks
      in mind.

  SET AND REMOVE CMDLETS
      The module has not yet evolved to the point of providing Set- and Remove-
      cmdlets.  Like with the New- cmdlets, the focus is on providing the
      cmdlets that deliver the most value, rather than covering 100% of the
      API just 'cause.  While full coverage is ideal, development time has not
      yet been able to meet that goal, yet.

EXAMPLES
  All of the cmdlets have help and examples built in.  For help on a specific
  cmdlet, use the normal route of "Get-Help -Full Get-XIO<someCmdlet>".

  Object URI
    To see what is the API URI of a particular object, you can just select the
    URI property of the given object:


        Get-XIOCluster | Select-Object Name,Uri

        Name       Uri
        ----       ---
        myxms01    https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/clusters/1


    To then use that URI for getting an object, you can use:


        Get-XIOItemInfo -URI https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/clusters/1

        Name     TotSSDTB UsedSSDTB FreeSSDTB ... DataReduction IOPS
        ----     -------- --------- --------- ... ------------- ----
        myxms01  7.59     4.46      3.12      ... 3.1           2729


    While this is not yet super exciting (it was easier to just Get-XIOCluster
    to get this cluster object), this provides the aforementioned capabilities
    of being able to retrieve new objects types provided by updated XtremIO
    APIs in the case where this PowerShell module has not yet caught up to the
    API update.  For example, when XIOS v4 came out, it provided 20+ new object
    types.  A subsequent update of this PowerShell module provided Get-*
    cmdlets for those new types, but, you could have gotten the new objects
    from crafting and using your own URIs in the interim.  Like, for example,
    if you wanted to get the DAE object information before there was a
    Get-XIODAE cmdlet, you could use:


        Get-XIOItemInfo -URI https://myxms01.com/api/json/types/daes/1 `
          -ReturnFullResponse


    This gets the DAE at index 1, and returns the full response object.  More
    on the -ReturnFullResponse parameter below (in the "Return Full Response"
    section).

    A likely more valuable use of specifying an explicit URI is for things that
    take query strings for modifying/filtering what object(s) are returned from
    the request.  For established cmdlets in this module, you should not need
    to specify any URI query string types of things.  But, again, for the use
    case where the XtremIO API gets updated and this PowerShell module has not
    yet been updated to cover such changes, you can explore and enjoy the API
    with your own custom crafted URI.  Let us say, for example, that in the
    same interim period as described in the previous example, we wanted to get
    a performance counter object for a particular entity type.  Through the
    process of a bit of trial and error, we can eventually arrive at a
    legitimate URI to get such a performance counter.  See these steps to
    arrive at a successful URI:


        Get-XIOItemInfo -URI https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/performance
        ...
        VERBOSE: (exception status of 'ProtocolError', message of 'The remote
            server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.')
        VERBOSE: WebException response:
        {
            "message": "Command Syntax Error: Missing some of mandatory
                properties list: ['entity']",
            "error_code": 400
        }


        Get-XIOItemInfo -URI `
          https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/performance/?entity=blahh
        ...
        VERBOSE: (exception status of 'ProtocolError', message of 'The remote
            server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.')
        VERBOSE: WebException response:
        {
            "message": "Command Syntax Error: entity property must have one of
                the following values: [SnapshotGroup, Initiator, Target, XEnv,
                DataProtectionGroup, Volume, Cluster, Tag, InitiatorGroup, SSD,
                TargetGroup, Xms]",
            "error_code": 400
        }


        Get-XIOItemInfo -ReturnFullResponse -URI `
          https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/performance/?entity=Cluster

        <success -- an object full of counter information is returned!>


  Return Full Response
    Returning the full response for an object gives you the ability to have and
    hold an object with _all_ of the available properties of that object type,
    with the raw property names as defined by the API, and with no additional
    Type handling/creation/manipulation by the PowerShell module.  This is
    generally quite useful at the time of writing new cmdlets, and is the main
    way that the developer of this module goes about such new Get-* cmdlet
    creation and through the type definitions and property correlations between
    objects.

    While the module should be providing most (all?) of the pertinent
    properties for objects, the ability to return the full response can make
    API/object exploration that much easier for the day that you find yourself
    wanting to spelunk a bit deeper.

    Specifying the -ReturnFullResponse switch parameter (available on Get-*
    cmdlets) gets you an object something like:


        Get-XIOCluster -ReturnFullResponse | Format-List

        content : @{compression-factor-text=3.5:1;
                  cluster-expansion-sym-current-step=no_expansion;
                  wr-iops-by-block=1722; num-of-rgs=1; wr-iops-16kb=38;
                  ...
        links   : {@{href=https://myxms01.dom.com/api/json/types/clusters/1;
                  rel=self}}


    To further inspect the object and see all of the wonderful properties
    available, you can access the .content property.
